# Getting started with Redux (and Material-UI plus FlexboxGrid)

This is based on Dan Abramov's [Redux course](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) and also trying to learn [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) and [FlexboxGrid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) APIs at the same time. I will be using these technologies for my upcoming projects.
```
npm install
```

Then

```
npm run start
```
